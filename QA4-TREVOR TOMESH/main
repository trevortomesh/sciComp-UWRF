//  Directions:  fix all the errors in this program to make it compile and 
//               run correctly.
//
/*  Modifications:
	-Added #include <math.h> and #include <string.h>
	-Changed all getch() to getchar() so will compile on mac
	-Capitolized file and added pointers
	-Deleted extra semi-colon in first int statement
	-Deleted extra "%" symbol in first scanf()
	-Replaced inputfile in fscanf with stdin
